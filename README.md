# event-center-website

For this project I was asked to make an event website using html and css. The project had to have a functioning navbar on every page, I did this by creating the navbar with html then styling it in css making sure it was at the top and layed out in a row.
I then focused on putting a banner under the navbar. I used a container with a div class called banner, and used an img link. From there i styled it in css making sure it was in the correct spot and stretched across the screen.
Next I coded the header, using the header tag with an h1 and h2.
For the main page I used 3 images as links to events that are happening, when clicked they will take you to the events page where it will go into detail about each event and the dates they will be held.
Also on the main page is the about section, this is where visitors will get info about what they cant expect when visiting and gives a little history about the place.

For the events page I used the same concept with the navbar, banner, and header.
I used the section id attrabute for each event and gave more info including the dates that you will be able to view them. Every event has an image included so the visitor knows exactly what they are reading about.

Now for the menu page same as before the functioning navbar, banner, and header, For the menu itself i used 3 different tables one for every course. I used the hr function to give it a more structured look.

The location page, I coded in a functioning navbar the place a banner below it.
I used a div class for the hours portion so I could style it in css and move the text where I wanted it.
I then used another div class for the map and used iframe tag to make it function.

For the contact page, i coded a functional navbar and instead of using a banner on this page i decided to do something differnt and used a backround image instead.
Visitors will find the phone number and email address here. They will also have a chance to fill out a form where they can put their name, email and a comment or concern that they would like to share. This form functions correctly and will not let you send without a valid email.
The send button also has a hover tag coded in where it will change colors when you hover over it.
This was a very fun project and i definitly learned alot from it. I hope you enjoy it!
